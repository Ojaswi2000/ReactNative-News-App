# ReactNative-News-App
This repository contains all necessary files and folders used for building my News App.I have used React Native to build this project.
<br>
### Libraries used 
1. `[Moment JS]`(https://momentjs.com/) -to handle the time,dates and the formatting to display when the news article was published.
2. `[Native Base.io]`(https://nativebase.io/) -to handle the UI by using its templates used in **TabScreen.js file**.
3. `[React Native Webview]`(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-webview) -to render web content in a native view, used in **Modal.js file**.
This is a glimpse of the final project that shows the three tabs and by clicking The **View** functionality, it passes the props onto the next page to show the clicked news article in great detail.
